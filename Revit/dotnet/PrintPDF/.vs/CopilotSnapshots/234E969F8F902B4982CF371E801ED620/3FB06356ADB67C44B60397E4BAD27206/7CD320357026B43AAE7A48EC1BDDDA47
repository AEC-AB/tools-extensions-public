# PrintPDF Extension (User Guide)

PrintPDF exports Revit **sheets** to PDF files. You choose *where to save*, *what to export*, *how to name the files*, and *how the PDF should look*.

---

## Before you start

- Open a Revit model.
- Make sure the model contains sheets (drawing sheets).
- Pick a folder where you have write access.

---

## Step-by-step (typical workflow)

1. **Destination Folder**
   - Click **Destination Folder** and choose where the PDF file(s) should be saved.
   - If the folder does not exist, the tool will try to create it.

2. **Choose What To Print**
   - Pick *one* of the options below.
   - Depending on what you choose, extra fields will appear.

3. **(Optional) Naming Options**
   - Decide how the PDF files should be named.

4. **(Optional) Combine**
   - Decide whether you want **one PDF per sheet** or **one combined PDF**.

5. **Configure Revit Print Settings**
   - Adjust quality, color, orientation, zoom, etc.

6. Run the tool
   - The selected sheets are exported as PDF(s) to the destination folder.

If the tool cannot find any sheets for your selection, it will finish with a message like “No sheets found …”.

## Choose What To Print (explained)

### 1) Active View
Use this if you want to export **the sheet you are currently looking at**.

- Requirement: Your current view must be a **sheet**.
- If your current view is not a sheet (for example a floor plan/3D view), the tool will stop and tell you.

### 2) All Sheets
Use this to export **every sheet in the model**.

- No extra fields are shown.

### 3) Set Filter Rules
Use this to export **only the sheets that match rules you define**.

When you choose this option, you will see:

- **Set Filter Rules**
  - Click to add rules for selecting sheets.
  - The tool only targets the **Sheets** category.

Examples of common rules:
- Sheet Name equals `A101`
- Sheet Number begins with `A-`
- A parameter (e.g. Discipline) equals `Architectural`

### 4) Sheet Set
Use this if you already maintain a **View/Sheet Set** in Revit and want to export it.

When you choose this option, you will see:

- **Sheet Set**
  - Select a set from the list, or type the name of the set.

### 5) Regex Pattern (Sheet Sets)
Use this if you want to export **multiple sheet sets at once** by searching their names using a pattern.

When you choose this option, you will see:

- **Regex Pattern**
  - Enter a pattern that matches sheet set names.
  - If the pattern is invalid, the tool stops.

This is intended for advanced users. If you don’t know what “regex” is, use **Sheet Set** instead.

### 6) Sheet Collection (Revit 2025+ only)
Use this if you maintain **Sheet Collections** (Revit 2025+).

When you choose this option, you will see:

- **Sheet Collection**
  - Select a collection from the list, or type the name.

### 7) Regex Pattern (Sheet Collections) (Revit 2025+ only)
Like “Regex Pattern (Sheet Sets)”, but it matches **Sheet Collection** names.

When you choose this option, you will see:

- **Regex Pattern**

## Naming Options (how PDF files are named)

### Naming Options
Choose a naming style for the exported PDFs.

Depending on what you choose, you will either configure simple parts (separator/prefix/suffix) or define a fully custom name.

### Separator in file Name
Shown when you are **not** using a fully custom naming convention.

- This is the text placed between parts of the name.
- Common examples: `-` or `_`.

### Prefix in file name (Optional)
Shown when you are **not** using a fully custom naming convention.

- Adds text at the start of the filename.
- Example: `PDF-` → `PDF-A101.pdf`

### Suffix in file name (Optional)
Shown when you are **not** using a fully custom naming convention.

- Adds text at the end of the filename.
- Example: `-Issued` → `A101-Issued.pdf`

### Custom Naming Convention
Shown only when **Naming Options** is set to a custom convention.

Write the filename pattern using placeholders in `{braces}`.

- You can use:
  - `{SheetName}`
  - `{ModelName}`
  - Parameter names that exist on the sheet (for example `{Discipline}`, `{Phase}`, `{Status}` if your project uses them)

Examples:
- `{SheetName}_{Phase}`
- `PDF_{ModelName}_{Discipline}`
- `Custom-{SheetName}-v1`

Tip: If a placeholder refers to a parameter that does not exist or is empty, the resulting filename may be incomplete.

## Single PDF vs Combined PDF

### Combine
- **Off**: exports **one PDF per sheet**.
- **On**: exports **one PDF containing all selected sheets**.

When **Combine** is enabled, additional fields may appear:

### Use sheet set name as PDF Name
Shown only when:
- **Combine** is enabled, and
- **Choose What To Print** is **Sheet Set**

If enabled, the combined PDF will be named after the selected sheet set.

### Combined File Name (Optional)
Shown only when:
- **Combine** is enabled, and
- **Use sheet set name as PDF Name** is **not** enabled

If you leave this empty, the tool may fall back to a default name.

Note:
- If you export *multiple* sheet sets/collections via a regex pattern, the tool exports **one combined PDF per matched set/collection**.

## Configure Revit Print Settings

These options affect PDF appearance and export behavior.

- **Always Use Raster**: forces raster processing (can help with some graphics but may reduce text crispness).
- **Color Depth Type**: black/white, grayscale, or color.
- **PDF Export Quality Type**: PDF DPI/quality.
- **Hide Crop Boundaries**: hides crop boundary lines.
- **Hide Reference Plane**: hides reference planes.
- **Hide Scope Boxes**: hides scope boxes.
- **Hide Unreferenced View Tags**: hides unreferenced tags.
- **Mask Coincident Lines**: improves readability when lines overlap.
- **Replace Halftone With Thin Lines**: makes halftone elements draw as thin lines.
- **View Links In Blue**: shows view links in blue.
- **Origin Offset X / Origin Offset Y**: shifts content position on the paper.
- **Zoom Percentage**: used when zoom is set to a percentage.
- **Paper Format**: paper size.
- **Page Orientation Type**: portrait/landscape/auto.
- **Paper Placement Type**: centered or offset.
- **Raster Quality Type**: raster DPI.
- **Zoom Type**: fit to page or zoom by percentage.
- **Open View On Export**: opens each view during export.

## Troubleshooting

- **“No active document found”**
  - Open a Revit model and try again.

- **“Please select a destination directory”**
  - Set **Destination Folder**.

- **“Active view is not a sheet”**
  - Switch to a sheet view and rerun (or choose All Sheets / Sheet Set).

- **“Invalid Regex pattern”**
  - Your pattern is not valid. If you’re not familiar with regex, use **Sheet Set** or **Sheet Collection** instead.

- **“No sheets found …”**
  - Your selection/filter/set name did not match any sheets.
