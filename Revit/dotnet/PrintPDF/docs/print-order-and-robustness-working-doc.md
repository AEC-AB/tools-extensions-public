# Print PDF Working Documents (index)

This repository previously had a single combined working document for multiple issues. It has been split into focused documents so each issue can be tracked independently. Use the links below to find the specific investigation and action items.

Docs created:

- `docs/issue-sheet-ordering.md` — Sheet ordering: reproduction, investigation, fixes, tests, and next steps.
- `docs/issue-empty-drawings.md` — Empty drawings: why empty PDFs may be produced, reproduction and fixes.
- `docs/issue-concurrency-race-conditions.md` — Concurrency and file rename races: temp file strategies, atomic moves, retries.
- `docs/issue-diagnostics-and-tests.md` — Diagnostics and tests: logging, diagnostic mode, unit/integration test plans.

Original combined content was archived into the individual docs. If you'd like the older combined file preserved, we can also keep a copy as `docs/print-order-and-robustness-working-doc-archive.md`.

Next steps:

- Open the specific issue doc you want to work on (for example, `docs/issue-sheet-ordering.md`) and I can begin the code-level investigation, add instrumentation, or implement the fixes.
- I can also update the repository's `README.md` or the project board with these issue doc links if that would help triage.
