A shared collection of extensions built to extend Assistant and evolve through community contributions.
# Assistant Public Extensions

This repository contains **public, open-source extensions for _Assistant by AEC_**.

The extensions in this repository are **generic, reusable building blocks** intended to support automation and standardization of workflows across common AEC software.

Only extensions that are:
- not company-specific
- not project-specific
- and do not contain internal or proprietary logic  

are included in this repository.

The goal is to grow a **shared extension library** that benefits the wider AEC community and helps establish consistent, executable workflows in Assistant.

## What is Assistant by AEC?

**Assistant by AEC** is an automation and orchestration platform for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry.

Assistant allows teams to:
- define repeatable workflows across multiple applications
- automate model-based and data-driven tasks
- standardize how projects are executed, regardless of who runs them

Assistant is not just about automation —  
its strongest ROI comes from **standardization made executable**.

Instead of relying on manuals, checklists, or individual experience, Assistant makes approved workflows runnable, repeatable, and auditable.
